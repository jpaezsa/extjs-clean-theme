This is a restructured version of the file mytheme.css intended to be functionally identical except for a few typeface & size standardizations and even these can be removed if you wish (see commit history & in file comments)

The file has been rebuilt with three things in mind:

1. Make it easy to change the typeface
2. Make it easier to play with the colors
3. Standardize typefaces
